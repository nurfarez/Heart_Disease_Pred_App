# Discussion

#The best scaler and classifier for this model is logistic regression with MinMaxScaler

#The model accuracy has been increased from 0.73 to 0.71 after the hypertuning with GridSearchCV where
#the best parameters/estimators of this model is C=100 and solver of lbfgs after hypertuning

#retrain with test data, got accuracy of with best model after tuning [90%]

# For future researcher, its best to stay with default model where the model accuracy might increased
#compared with the tuning model.
